Additional Elements and Their Purpose:

Load Balancer (HAproxy): Introduces load balancing for distributing incoming traffic among multiple servers to ensure high availability and improved performance.
Secondary Node (Replica): Provides database replication for data redundancy, fault tolerance, and improved read performance.

Load Balancer Configuration:

Distribution Algorithm: Configured with Round Robin, which evenly distributes incoming requests among the available servers.

Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup:

The setup is Active-Active. In this configuration, all servers actively handle incoming traffic, sharing the load. Active-Passive would involve one server handling traffic while the others remain in standby.

Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Database Cluster:

How it Works: The Primary (Master) node handles both read and write operations. The Replica (Slave) nodes replicate data from the Primary node and can be used for read operations. Replication ensures data consistency and fault tolerance.

Difference Between Primary and Replica Nodes:

Primary Node: Handles write operations and serves as the authoritative source for data changes.
Replica Node: Replicates data from the Primary node and can be used for read operations. It provides redundancy and can temporarily take over in case of Primary node failure.

Issues:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

The Web Server, Application Server, and Database all represent potential single points of failure. Introducing redundancy and failover mechanisms would be essential for improving reliability.

Security Issues:

The infrastructure lacks a firewall, exposing servers to potential security threats. Additionally, there is no HTTPS, which poses a security risk for data transmission. Implementing a firewall and HTTPS are crucial for securing the infrastructure.

No Monitoring:

Without monitoring, there is no visibility into the health and performance of the servers, application, or database. Implementing monitoring tools is necessary to detect issues proactively and ensure optimal performance.

Improvements could include introducing redundancy for critical components, implementing a firewall, enabling HTTPS, and integrating monitoring tools for enhanced reliability and security.
